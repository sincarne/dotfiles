## `imapfilter/config.lua`
Configuration file for [`imapfilter`](https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter). Pretty boring. The one cool thing in there is the script that archives sent mail on the first of the month.

## `bash/*`
Some stuff I wrote, or are related to files I use. Much of the clever stuff is sourced from:
* http://mths.be/dotfiles
* https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles
* http://brettterpstra.com/

## `nano/*`
I like `nano`, although I'm starting to like `micro` more. Also includes buckets of syntax definitions, because those are increasingly hard to find. Syntax files are expected in `~/.nano/`
